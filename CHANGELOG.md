## [Unreleased]

### Den

- `POST /term/inject` writes only into sessions whose roster entry is an agent harness (`room: true`). Terminal-only sessions (`room: false`) answer 409 `session is not an agent harness` and nothing is written to the PTY (#810). Custom harness entries must set `room: true` to receive chat; terminal-only entries are typed through the terminal. Typing into a shell remains the terminal websocket.
- When a herdr-backed coding agent exits, den reaps the PTY and mux session after a short grace so chat inject 409s instead of writing into the leftover shell (#791). Adopted harness panes stay closed to inject until a pane-scoped `pane list`/`agent list` probe (or a working|idle|blocked frame, or `pane.agent_detected` with a live agent) proves a live agent; a fresh create stays not-ready and re-probes instead of killing a still-booting harness; `POST /term` during the grace mints a new pty immediately.
- Term ready-gate waits for output quiescence or herdr agent-idle (not first-chunk + delay). The first buffered inject on an agent pane is confirmed only by a herdr `working` frame; unconfirmed turns are recorded on the pty and never retried (#796).
- Claude transcript adapter strips Claude Code's `<pasted_content id="…">…</pasted_content id="…">` framing from a parsed user turn before it reaches the transcript, and from the session drawer title (#818). The den injects chat as a bracketed paste, which Claude Code wraps and stores verbatim; left as-is the wrapper showed as raw tags in the user bubble and, because the web client retires an optimistic bubble by exact-text match with no id, duplicated the turn. The strip is paired and id-anchored, so literal user text that merely mentions the tag is left untouched.

### RivetHub client

- Composer model picker for conversations whose harness supports choosing a model per turn.
- `apps/rivethub-web`: the per-turn model picker is a searchable popover instead of a flat dropdown, so big catalogs (opencode, codex) are usable. The session default comes first, then ★ Pinned (star any row), ◷ Recent (your last 5 picks), and a short slice of All with the rest behind "N more"; the current pick is never hidden. Search spans the whole catalog, and the picker works from the keyboard. Pins and recents are per harness and kept in the browser; pure view curation, so any model can still be picked.
- `apps/rivethub-web`: the composer autofocuses on landing in a conversation and when switching to another, so you can type without clicking first. Waits for the socket (the textarea is disabled while reconnecting) and fires once per session. It never pulls focus from something you're already using — an inline rename, a filter, a dialog, or the terminal — and skips touch devices so a tap can't raise the keyboard over the transcript.
- `apps/rivethub-web`: prevent sidebar and composer node pickers flashing while discovery is pending or failed with one saved node; keep multiple saved nodes available immediately (#809).
- `apps/rivethub-web`: hide node pickers only when connected to the sole saved node (or the app origin with no saved nodes) and mesh discovery confirms no peers; keep discovery and first-peer saving available.

### Harness integrations

- `opencode` harness (id `opencode`, provider `opencode-cli`, roster `opencode`) surfaced in RivetHub web, Android, and docs. Default `model` is `zai/glm-5.3-flash`. The installed OpenCode CLI owns backend, endpoint, and credentials.
- `pi` memory capture (`integrations/pi/rivet-memory`): v3 session jsonl watcher under `agent=rivet-deepseek` / `channel=pi`, systemd user unit `pi-memory-capture.service` / launchd `dev.rivetos.pi-capture`, wired into `rivetos plugins install` and doctor.

### Harness

- `pi` harness (earendil-works/pi, provider `pi-cli`, roster command `pi`) on RivetHub web + Android, with a commented `@rivetos/provider-pi-cli` config example (recommended default backend z.ai GLM).
- feat(harness): add qwen-code — Qwen Code CLI as the eighth first-class harness (driver, provider, executor, hooks-driven memory capture via a qwen extension, web + Android).
- RivetHub client — new chats and registered harness sessions open in Chat; legacy sessions wait for registry resolution and fall back to Terminal on failure, with the settled view remembered across navigation.

### RivetHub client

- Sidebar Agents: pre-fill the existing create form from unsaved edits when a preset’s node fails to load harnesses, validate settings against another reachable node, and create a copy; the original stays on its node and can be deleted when it is reachable again. Surface save and delete failures.

### RivetHub client

- Chat: preserve in-flight sends, ordering, and visible failure/retry across draft adoption and native-id rotation (#795).
- Chat: a committed user turn retires the optimistic bubble of the send it confirms — by item id when the echo carries one, otherwise the accepted/sending bubble before a failed twin of the same text — so repeating a message can no longer retire the wrong bubble or strand the committed send's own.

### Breaking

- Per-user memory routing reads only the users.json registry (`RIVETOS_USERS_FILE`, else `$RIVETOS_SHARED_DIR/rivetos/users.json`, else `~/.rivetos/users.json`). The `RIVETOS_USER_DBS` and `RIVETOS_DEN_DEVICE_USERS` env maps are removed — leftover values do not route.
- Removed the `deepseek-harness` (dsh) harness — `HARNESS_IDS` token, `@rivetos/harness-deepseek`, `integrations/deepseek` capture plugin, and the `deepseek`/`dsh` preset aliases (presets using them no longer map to a harness); nodes with a `dsh` roster entry in `~/.rivetos/den-term.json` need `rivetos plugins install --force` or a hand edit.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-30

First stable release. Everything since the 0.4.0 public beta: gateway + RivetHub, den, harness control plane, memory wiki, device mTLS, and per-user tenancy. Workspace packages align at 0.5.0 (RivetHub Electron keeps its own 0.5.4 updater cadence).

### Runtime / mesh

- Self-registering plugin manifests (`PluginManifest` + `register(ctx)`); `transport` category; in-process `@rivetos/mcp-server`.
- Providers: dedicated `@rivetos/provider-vllm` and `@rivetos/provider-llama-server` replace `openai-compat`; `@rivetos/provider-claude-cli` drives local `claude` with an embedded MCP bridge.
- Agent loop on the AI SDK (`@rivetos/aisdk`); providers migrated to official AI SDK packages.
- Mesh mTLS (shared CA, HTTPS agent channel, `mesh.tls`, `.mesh` DNS). **Breaking: all mesh nodes must upgrade together.** `mesh.secret` is ignored for agent-channel auth (warning on load); remove it from config.
- `rivetos mesh enroll` / `mesh sync` / `mesh renew` (SSH hub helper, unpack issued certs + `mesh.json`); doctor warns when the leaf expires within 30 days. **Breaking:** `mesh join <host>` without `--manual` exits non-zero — use `mesh enroll` or `mesh join --manual` (#599).
- Durable task engine (`ros_tasks`): chat-loop executor, heartbeats, subagents, mesh delegation over shared Postgres, evaluation/retry/escalation.
- Gateway embedded in the rivetos process: `/api/tasks`, catalog, sessions, notifications WS, uploads, wiki, memory, workflows.
- Workflows v1: journal-replay engine, step SDK, budget/`parallel`, gateway + RivetHub runs UI (#438, #441–#446).
- MCP unification: core + sidecar split, era-negotiating stdio, MCP 2026-07-28 final / SDK 2.0 (#275, #276, #435, #451).
- `RIVETOS_INSTALL_ROOT` and `RIVETOS_SHARED_DIR` replace hardcoded install-root and shared-dir defaults (#595, #590).
- Identity contract in workspace templates — verify before assuming, maintain the user roster (#594).
- Removed: Pulumi IaC, split container images, Telegram/Discord/voice-discord channels (Phase 5, #490), unused circuit-breaker/audit-rotation exports (#463), Rivet Team product (#530).

### Memory / wiki

- Memory v5 compaction (leaf/branch/root + tool-call synthesis) and hybrid search (FTS + trigram + vector/RRF).
- Compaction and embedding moved onto graphile-worker (`services/{compaction,embedding}-worker`).
- Memory wiki: page model, extract/consolidate/recompile, durable topics and Wikipedia-style articles, `/api/wiki` + hub UI, `wiki_search`/`wiki_read` (#285–#292, #414, #416).
- `memory_get_full` disk-pointer recall; `window=` shortcuts; tool rows excluded from browse by default (#546); tool_result search/embed (#440, #482).
- Per-user memory routing (device identity → per-user database) (#561); `/api/memory` routed by the den-stamped user (#571).
- Compaction skips heartbeats (#518); deadlock retry + wiki enqueue after commit (#542); `rivetos memory retry-failed` (#508).

### RivetHub client

- `apps/rivethub-web`: chat-first hub over the gateway — transcript, composer, node switcher, terminal, files, memory Search/Browse/Stats, wiki, workflows/flows canvas (#295–#307, #428–#433, #502, #550).
- Desktop shell migrated from Tauri to Electron (`apps/rivethub-electron`) (#555); in-app updates from the mesh filestore (#562). Electron stays on its own 0.5.x updater cadence (0.5.4 as of #587).
- Composer attachments, interactive ask card, voice mode (#576); per-session node binding (#583); agents roster in the sidebar (#549).
- Loopback mTLS pipe so the desktop client presents device certs to the gateway (#494).
- `apps/rivet-bots-android`: Grok Bot-style client where every bot is a mesh agent node (#541, #544, #545).

### Den

- New stack: `@rivetos/den-protocol`, `@rivetos/den-server` (harness event contract, PTY terminals, mesh overview).
- Den embedded in the rivetos process; harness adapters (Claude Code, Grok Build, later Hermes/Kimi/DeepSeek); MicBridge host-mic input (#418); voice transcribe/speak proxy (#574).
- Harness control-plane fencing per session owner (#580, #582); idle auto-close of unattached harness PTYs (#439, #514).
- DeepSeek `dsh` TUI driver (#539).

### Harness integrations

- Harness control-plane contract + `SessionId` codec (#456); drivers for Claude Code (#458), Grok Build (#472), Hermes (#477), kimi-code (#480), DeepSeek (#539).
- Rotation re-keying and superseded lifecycle (#470); reasoning-delta on the contract (#469); gateway attachment staging (#465).
- Capture plugins: Grok Build, Hermes, Kimi Code, Grok Bot memory bridge (#517); kimi-code headless executor + wire.jsonl backfill (#474, #481).
- RivetHub and Android chat bound to the harness control plane (#466, #479).

### Tenancy / multi-user

- Mesh device enrollment (QR pairing) and per-device datahub credentials (#357, #366).
- Gateway Rivet CA device mTLS; bearer tokens removed (#491). **Breaking: clients must present a device cert.**
- Resolve the user at the den edge and filter RivetHub by owner (#565); wiki/memory/harness surfaces honor the routed user (#571, #579, #580, #581).
- Early per-user identity (profile `USER.md` + memory tag) generalized into the owner-user model.

### Release / infra

- Unified `rivetos` container image (`--role`); GHCR publish; `@rivetos/cli` installable via `npm install -g`.
- Versioned SQL migrations as source of truth; Nx module-boundary enforcement; secret scanner (#363); commit authorship check (#552).
- `docs/RELEASES.md` release policy; docs truth-sweep to Phase-5 reality (#589, #593).
- Workspace versions normalized to 0.5.0 for the first stable tag (this release). Lockfile refresh (`npm install`) must land in the PR — CI runs `npm ci`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-05

First public beta. Containerized distribution, reliability hardening, and launch documentation across three internal milestones (M6 containers, M7 reliability, M8 docs).

### Added

- Containerized distribution: agent + datahub Dockerfiles, root `docker-compose.yaml`, Nx container build targets, `DATA-PERSISTENCE.md` model, CI pipeline.
- `rivetos build`, `rivetos init` interactive wizard, `rivetos config`, `rivetos agent add/remove/list`, `rivetos update` source-based update flow.
- Pulumi infrastructure components and `rivetos infra up/preview/destroy` (later removed in 0.4.x).
- Reliability primitives: `RivetError` hierarchy, channel `ReconnectionManager`, provider circuit breaker, memory connection pooling, structured logging, audit log rotation.
- Observability: `rivetos logs`, runtime metrics, `/health`, `/health/live`, `/metrics` endpoints, enhanced `rivetos status` and `rivetos doctor`, `rivetos test` smoke suite.
- Secret management: `redactSecrets()`, `.env` permission enforcement, config secret validation, 1Password `op://` resolution.
- Multi-agent mesh: `FileMeshRegistry`, `MeshDelegationEngine`, mesh HTTP endpoints, `rivetos mesh` CLI, `rivetos init --join`, `rivetos update --mesh`.
- Launch docs: `GETTING-STARTED`, `CONFIG-REFERENCE`, `PLUGINS`, `SKILLS`, `DEPLOYMENT`, `TROUBLESHOOTING`, example configs, `rivetos plugin init`, `rivetos skill init`, `rivetos skill validate`.

### Changed

- Node.js requirement: 22 → 24.
- All package versions normalized to 0.4.0 (was unreleased 1.0.0 placeholders).
- Containers moved from `containers/` to `infra/containers/`.
- Plugin discovery is convention-based via `package.json` `rivetos` field; all plugins export `createPlugin()` factory.
- Root `package.json` no longer leaks plugin dependencies (only `yaml` remains).

### Removed

- Backward-compat runtime shim `core/src/runtime.ts`.
- Architecture violation: `memory-postgres/review-loop.ts` no longer imports from `@rivetos/core`.

## [0.0.8] - 2026-04-03

### Changed

- **License** — changed from MIT to Apache License 2.0. NOTICE file added.
- **Documentation overhaul** — updated all markdown files to reflect current architecture and features.
- Deleted `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `REFACTOR_PROGRESS.md`, `docs/PHASE2.md`, `docs/MILESTONE-2-3-ANALYSIS.md` (obsolete).

## [0.0.7] - 2026-04-03

### Changed

- **Runtime decomposition** — `runtime.ts` (576 lines) split into focused modules:
  - `runtime.ts` (296 lines) — thin compositor, registration, routing, lifecycle
  - `turn-handler.ts` (263 lines) — single message turn processing
  - `media.ts` (105 lines) — attachment resolution, download, multimodal content
  - `streaming.ts`, `sessions.ts`, `commands.ts` — already extracted, unchanged
- **Delegation/subagent/skills registration** moved from `Runtime.start()` to `boot/registrars/agents.ts` for consistency with other registrars.
- Net -280 lines from runtime. Runtime no longer knows about images, base64, content parts, history management, hook execution, or memory appending.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **Boot package** (`@rivetos/boot`) — composition root properly decomposed:
  - `config.ts` — YAML config loading with env var resolution
  - `validate.ts` — schema validation with structured error/warning reporting
  - `lifecycle.ts` — PID file, signal handlers, shutdown
  - `registrars/providers.ts` — provider instantiation
  - `registrars/channels.ts` — channel instantiation
  - `registrars/hooks.ts` — safety, fallback, auto-action, session hook wiring
  - `registrars/tools.ts` — tool plugin registration
  - `registrars/memory.ts` — memory backend wiring
  - `registrars/agents.ts` — delegation, subagent, skills registration
- **`typecheck` target** on all 21 nx packages — `tsc --noEmit` catches type errors independently per package.
- **Typing indicators** for Discord channel plugin (same pattern as Telegram — channel-managed, runtime-agnostic).
- **Message splitting** in channel plugins — Discord (2000 char) and Telegram (4096 char) handle overflow internally. Runtime has zero knowledge of message length limits.
- **Safety cap fix** — when agent hits tool iteration limit, preserves the accumulated response text instead of replacing it with a generic message.

### Changed

- **CLI rewired** — imports from `@rivetos/boot` instead of `../../../../src/boot.js`. No more rootDir violations.
- **Telegram typing refactored** — typing indicator management moved from internal `handleMessage()` wrapping to public `startTyping()`/`stopTyping()` methods, then back to channel-internal management (matching Discord's pattern). Runtime doesn't touch typing.
- **21/21 packages typecheck clean** — fixed ~138 type errors across the monorepo (config types, tool result types, delegation types, missing tsconfigs).

### Removed

- **`src/boot.ts`** — 500-line god file replaced by `@rivetos/boot` package with 7 focused files.
- **`src/config.ts`**, **`src/validate.ts`** — moved to `packages/boot/src/`.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **`rivetos logs`** — tail runtime logs with filtering (`--lines`, `--follow`, `--since`, `--grep`, `--json`). Wraps `journalctl` for systemd service, falls back to log file reading.
- **`rivetos skills list`** — discovers all skills from `skill_dirs`, parses SKILL.md frontmatter, shows name/description/trigger count.
- **`rivetos plugins list`** — enumerates configured providers, channels, memory backends, and tools with status (configured / available / missing-key).
- **`rivetos login`** — OAuth login for Anthropic subscription auth.

### Changed

- **CLI extracted to `@rivetos/cli`** (`packages/cli/`) — independent Nx package with own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, build/test targets. Enables `nx run cli:build`, `nx run cli:test`, affected-only testing, and Nx caching. Old `src/cli/` removed.
- `@rivetos/cli` path alias added to `tsconfig.base.json`.
- Root `bin` entry updated to point to `packages/cli/src/index.ts`.

### Milestone

- **0.5 — CLI Tools: Complete.** All planned CLI commands shipped. `mesh list/ping/remove` moved to Milestone 6.6 (Fleet Management).

## [0.0.4] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **Config validation engine** (`packages/boot/src/validate.ts`) — schema validation on startup with structured error/warning reporting
  - Missing required fields, invalid types, unknown keys
  - Cross-reference validation: agents ↔ providers, heartbeats, channel bindings, coding pipeline
  - Warns on hardcoded API keys/tokens in config (use env vars)
  - Warns on out-of-range values (temperature, max_tokens)
  - Human-readable error messages with config path and available options
- **`rivetos config validate`** CLI command — dry-run config validation without starting the runtime
- **Upgraded `rivetos doctor`** — now runs schema validation, config-aware env var checks, and provider connectivity tests
- 62 unit tests for config validation covering all sections, cross-references, edge cases
- `ConfigValidationError` thrown on boot with formatted output when config is invalid

### Changed

- `loadConfig()` now validates schema before resolving env vars — catches structural issues early
- `rivetos doctor` version bumped to match package version
- Root test script now includes validation tests alongside Nx project tests

## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Core runtime with agent loop, router, workspace loader, message queue
- Streaming-first provider interface (`AsyncIterable<StreamEvent>`)
- Domain-driven design with clean architecture (types → domain → application → plugins)
- **Providers:** Anthropic (with OAuth subscription auth), Google Gemini, xAI Grok, Ollama, llama-server
- **Channels:** Telegram (grammY) with typing indicator, inline buttons, reactions
- **Memory:** PostgreSQL adapter with full transcript archive, summary DAG, hybrid FTS+vector search
- **Tools:** Shell execution with safety categorization and AbortSignal support
- Full command surface: `/stop`, `/interrupt`, `/steer`, `/new`, `/status`, `/model`, `/think`, `/reasoning`
- Message queue with deterministic behavior (commands immediate, messages queued)
- Session persistence across restarts via Memory plugin
- Thinking level control (off/low/medium/high) mapped to provider-specific parameters
- CLI: `rivetos start/stop/status/doctor/config/version` + provider commands
- Toggleable structured logging via `RIVETOS_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- YAML configuration with `${ENV_VAR}` resolution
- GitHub Actions CI
- Apache 2.0 license
